# Heart_Disease_prediction_Project

In this project, my aim was to predict whether a person has a risk of heart disease in the upcoming 10 years.



Steps:

1) Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.

2) Did the necessary data analysis and data preprocessing using ML pipelines.

3) Compared 6 machine learning models and finally ended up with XGBoost.

4) Selected the best features and tuned the model.

5) Used Flask to integrate the pickle file (containing the model) and a simple HTML code for the frontend.

6) Created the necessary files and deployed them on Heroku.
